#  Weather app

__Make an app that pulls weather forecast data for the user's current location, from http://openweathermap.org/ , and displays it nicely. The app doesn't need to look very fancy. You also need to sign up for a free licence key. (You don't need to submit the key, we have our own.)__

## Details

- Written in Objective-C
- No third party software
- MVVM design pattern
- Please, insert app key in `ICForecastTableViewModel`
